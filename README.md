# Script Identification

## Overview
This project focuses on identifying the script of a given scene text word using traditional machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the [Bharat Scene Text Dataset](https://github.com/Bhashini-IITJ/BharatSceneTextDataset.git). The objective is to explore and compare multiple ML techniques for script classification, ensuring systematic performance evaluation and qualitative analysis.

## Tasks
- Implement at least four traditional ML techniques (e.g., KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, PCA, LDA, ANN, etc.).
- Compare results using different performance measures and conduct failure case analysis.
- Submit a mid-project report and a final comprehensive report following the given guidelines.
- Develop a project page, spotlight video, and maintain a well-documented GitHub repository.
- Provide a working demo and appear for a final viva with the instructor.
